Hello,

This is a chip8 emulator written in Odin. It's not a perfect emulator but it does work and was tested to at least play breakout.

This was done as a learning project and I have learned quite a bit from this. 

you can run the project by running odin run . in your cli. You can change roms by opening up the chip8.odin file and in the main proc, change the file to whatever is either in the roms folder, or a rom you provide yourself.
